# Axelar Request for Comments (ARCs)

## Overview

This repository hosts Axelar Request for Comments (ARCs), which are technical design documents describing standards, protocol upgrades, and architectural changes to the Axelar network. ARCs define proposed modifications to the core protocol infrastructure, similar to how Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs) standardize functionality on Ethereum.

## Purpose

The ARC design documents aim to:

1. Document proposed changes to the Axelar protocol architecture
2. Specify technical implementations for network upgrades
3. Define improvements to the cross-chain communication layer
4. Establish protocol-level security enhancements
5. Formalize consensus mechanisms and validator operations

## ARC Process

The ARC process is designed for rigorous technical evaluation:

1. **Draft**: An initial technical design document is submitted by the protocol engineering team
2. **Review**: Core developers and security researchers conduct technical assessment
3. **Specification**: Detailed technical specifications and implementation plans are formalized
4. **Implementation**: Reference implementation is developed and tested
5. **Activation**: Protocol upgrade is scheduled and deployed to the network

## Categories

ARCs fall into several technical categories:

- **Amplifier Protocol**: Enhancements to the cross-chain communication protocol
- **Interchain Token Protocol**: Enhancements to the application layer token standardization protocol
- **Cryptography**: Updates to cryptographic primitives and security models
- **Governance**: Changes to protocol governance and parameter optimization
- **Meta**: Improvements to the ARC process itself
